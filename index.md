## About Me

I am a computer engineering student at Ege University and I love creating things like robotic systems and computer games. Here, you can find some of my projects with detailed descriptions and projects I am working on.<br>

### Skills

I have a good understanding of low-level languages like C. I initally write my algorithms in high-level languages like Pyhton, Java, C# then I convert them to C. Memory and time efficiency is my priorty thanks to Atmega328 microchips. I have been working on microchips for 3 years and since then I made several robotic and automation projects (you can found them on my [github](https://github.com/ARXINO) page).
